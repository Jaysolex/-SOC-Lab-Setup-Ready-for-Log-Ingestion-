30-Day SOC Challenge — daily hands-on log analysis, threat hunting, and detections and SOC tools set up


# 🛡️ 30-Day SOC Challenge  

Welcome to my **30-Day SOC Challenge** 🚀 — a hands-on journey where I practice, document, and showcase daily SOC (Security Operations Center) skills.  

📌 **Goal:** Strengthen SOC Analyst skills through daily labs, detections, and investigations.  
📌 **Tools Used:** Wazuh, Zeek, Suricata, Wireshark, Sigma, Sysmon, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, ELK and others  
📌 **Focus Areas:** Threat detection, incident response, log analysis, and threat hunting.
